/**
 * Inner Membrane Module
 *
 * The Inner Membrane is the protected core of Deep Tree Echo's cognitive architecture.
 * It contains the agent's core identity, native inference capabilities, and autonomous
 * operation systems.
 *
 * Components:
 * - CoreIdentity: Manages the agent's sense of self and AAR dynamics
 * - NativeInferenceEngine: Provides lightweight, autonomous inference
 * - AutonomousController: Coordinates inner membrane operations
